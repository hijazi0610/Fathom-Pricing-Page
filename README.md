# Fathom-Pricing-Page

### This is a mini project to clone [Fathom pricing page](https://usefathom.com/pricing) where the focus is on the following: 

* Loop through arrays of plans and FAQs
* Toggle show more/less plans
* Conditional CSS(border and icon) for selected plan
* Toggle expand/collapse accordion

### Please note that this project is not mobile responsive. It's still work in progress to showcase 4 points mentioned above only.
